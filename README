Annoyed with when clicking "View" on photo attachments in gmail & them coming up sideways in a new tab, i wrote this to one-click rotate them for better viewing.
This seems to happen for me any time an iPhone email with photo attachment is in question.

Simply click extension icon to rotate gmail photo attachment in browser after clicking "View".
